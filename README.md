# Pokemon-Dashboard

## About the project
This project was used to showcase what I can do with data visualisation as an aid to my hobby of playing the battle facilities in the Pokémon games. Combining the skills I gained in a 
Data skills bootcamp with my passion and love for things I love.

## Content
A dive into Pokémon attribute data using Tableau Dashboard for Pokemon from Gen 1 to Gen 6.

This repository contains the visual data in the form of a dashboard and the data set downloaded from Kaggle and Tableau for analysing specific questions that might come up when formualting an ideal team. Also included the presentation used

## Description
* Looked at ways Excel can help search for entries in the data set using Index Match, IF, SUMIF/SUMIFS, SUMPRODUCT.
